# Creating a data base and query it. The data came from multi sources, an internet api and from a csv file.
For this project, I utilized Python and the MySQL package to construct a database by combining two sources of information: an online database accessed through an API and a CSV file containing NFL player data. The ultimate goal was to create an application that could serve as a resource for NFL scouts to gather knowledge about college players and their success in the league over a period of five years.

I created functions to build the database, generate tables, and populate them with the appropriate data. Throughout the process, I followed best practices for creating a well-organized database with correct connections between tables, effective indexing, and logical relationships.
